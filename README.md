# BoilerPlate with Tailwindcss for Building Landing Pages

Hi everyone, I've made a boilerplate with tailwindcss framework for building Landing Pages.

## Why Tailwind ?
why tailwindcss I am using because uses a default mobile-first approach. 
The availability of utility classes makes it easier to build complex responsive layouts freely.

## Get Started
> git clone https://github.com/canucotdaved/boilerplate-landing

> npm install / yarn 

> yarn tailwind
